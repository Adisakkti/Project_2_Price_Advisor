    "**Objective:**\n",
    "1. To create a Model that helps homeowners accurately price their properties for sale, maximizing returns and simplifying the selling process\n",
    "2. Evaluating real estate prices in the Bangkok, Nonthaburi, and Samut Prakan areas.\n",
    "               \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Many homeowners face challenges in accurately valuating their properties when looking to sell. The absence of reliable and data-driven valuation tools often leads to overpricing or underpricing, potentially resulting in delayed sales or missed opportunities. There is a need for an accessible and accurate tool that empowers homeowners to set optimal asking prices and maximize their returns within a reasonable time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**  \n",
    "1. How can the Model ensure accurate property valuations while considering various factors like location, size, facilities, and market trends?\n",
    "2. What features and functionalities should be incorporated to create a user-friendly experience for homeowners seeking property valuations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The proposed solution is to develop an intuitive tool that allows homeowners to input property details and receive instant, accurate valuations. This platform will leverage robust data integration from reliable real estate sources and utilize advanced algorithms to calculate valuations based on a comprehensive set of factors including location, property type, size, amenities, and current market conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**The model will be able to accurately assess house prices if we select appropriately sized features, good features that are relevant to the price. Therefore, I recommend these features that will allow the model to calculate prices accurately**\n",
    "1. Bedroom \n",
    "2. Bathroom  \n",
    "3. Nearby station\n",
    "4. Floor area \n",
    "5. Floor level\n",
    "6. Nearby shop \n",
    "7. Nearby station\n",
    "8. Long distance \n",
    "9. Lat distance\n",
    "10. District\n",
    "11. Property type \n",
    "#### when using Ridge regression, the model performs the best and is the most accurate based on all the experiments conducted so i reccomended to use Ridge Regression\n",
